# Improving a Multiple Linear Regression Model by Applying Feature Engineering
It contains an extensive application of feature engineering (feature selection and logarithmic transformations) to identify the most useful features of an already existed multiple linear regression (MLR) model. The goal of the project is to enhance model's generalization indirectly, through feature engineering, without the use of machine learning techniques. Ultimately, a newly-created, simpler and capable model is created with an adjusted R-Square equal to 0.7963 keeping only 10 features despite having created dummies for all categorical variables.

## FILES INCLUDED:
1. Data Files X 1:
   * The cleaned file from the previous project (.csv)
2. The core file, named 'main' (.ipynb) X 1
--> I clear the cell outputs in Jupyter to maintain a clean code appearance. Please follow the instructions below to see how my code is executed.
3. The README File
--> 3 Files in Total <--

## HOW TO SET UP THE ENVIRONMENT:
1. Download the project as a zip file or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Anaconda Prompt and type:
--> conda create --name 'YourEnvName' python=3.11.9 jupyterlab=4.2.2 pandas=2.2.2 numpy=2.0.0 matplotlib=3.8.4 seaborn=0.13.2 statsmodels=0.14.2 scikit-learn=1.5.0 -c conda-forge
3. Activate the newly-created environment.
4. Launch Jupyter via Anaconda Prompt.
5. Open the project's Jupyter named 'main'.
6. Enjoy!
