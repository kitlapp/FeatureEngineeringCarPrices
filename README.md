Predicting car prices using linear regression, focusing on feature selection to optimize model accuracy and simplicity

## Project Description
This project aims to predict car prices using linear regression model. By exploring feature selection, we aim to create models that are not only accurate but also simple and easy to interpret. This project is particularly focused on understanding the impact of different features on the predictive power of the model, leveraging the simplicity and interpretability of a linear regression.

## Project Features 
1) Data Cleaning: Prepare the data for modelling by creating different versions of data frames.
2) Feature Selection: Apply trial-and-error approaches to select the most impactful features that improve the model performance.
3) Model Evaluation: Compare the different models based on feature weights and performance metrics to determine the optimal settings.
4) Log Transformation: Apply logarithmic transformation to the target variable to improve model accuracy and handl skewed data.
