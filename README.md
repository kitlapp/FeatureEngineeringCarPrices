# Improving a Multiple Linear Regression Model through Feature Engineering
It contains the application of feature engineering techniques, specifically feature selection and logarithmic transformations, to improve an existing multiple linear regression (MLR) model. The primary goal is to enhance the model's generalization capabilities by improving data quality without using additional machine learning algorithms. As a result, a simplified but effective model was created with an adjusted RÂ² of 0.7963, using only 10 features despite generating dummy variables for all categorical features.

## FILES INCLUDED:
1. Data Files X 1:
   * The cleaned file from the previous project (.csv)
2. The core file, named 'main' (.ipynb) X 1
--> I clear the cell outputs in Jupyter to maintain a clean code appearance. Please follow the instructions below to see how my code is executed.
3. The README File

## HOW TO SET UP THE ENVIRONMENT:
1. Download the project as a zip file or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Anaconda Prompt and type:
--> conda create --name 'YourEnvName' python=3.11.9 jupyterlab=4.2.2 pandas=2.2.2 numpy=2.0.0 matplotlib=3.8.4 seaborn=0.13.2 statsmodels=0.14.2 scikit-learn=1.5.0 -c conda-forge
3. Activate the newly-created environment.
4. Launch Jupyter via Anaconda Prompt.
5. Open the project's Jupyter named 'main'.
6. Enjoy!
